\section{Technology Demonstrations}

\subsection{Testing Satellite Tether Deployment and Operations}

Satellite tethers can be used to create artificial gravity to aide in long term human missions by tethering a crew module to an object of equal mass and rotating the system. These systems need to be tested before they can be used for such operations. \cite{Ref:Carlson}\cite{Ref:Mazzoleni}

\subsection{The CanX-4\&5 Formation Flying Mission: A Technology Pathfinder for Nanosatellite Constellations}

Accuracy and miniaturization of propulsion systems, attitude determination
sensors, control systems, inter-satellite communication systems and
relative position sensors is one of the key aspects for future small
satellite missions. The two spacecrafts Can X-4\&5 have been designed
as a technology demonstrator of these capabilities as independent
spacecraft but also to cooperate in flight formation. Both spacecraft
will have access to the state vector of the other spacecraft wirelessly.
In addition, the pair of small satellites has been equipped with a
sub-meter relative position control, a centimeter-accuracy relative
position determination, a GPS receiver, an on board computer and an
inter-satellite communication system.\cite{Bonin_FF_CanX-4&5}
