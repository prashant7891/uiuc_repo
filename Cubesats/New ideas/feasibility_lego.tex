{\Huge Feasibility Analysis: Lego satellites}
\end{center}

I have listed below the best of the sensors and actuators that are available in the market. These have been taken from our literature survey report. Since this is a technology demonstration, we can choose our design parameters as long as they satisfy the achievable limit.   

\begin{itemize}
\item GPS
\begin{itemize}
\item Present accuracy: $\pm$ 20m 
\end{itemize}

\item Star tracker
\begin{itemize}
\item Advantages
\begin{itemize}
\item Only 1 needed, hence reducing complexity and error build-up (\href{http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1238&context=smallsat}{this itself can be a tech demo of sorts})
\item Always functional, no interference with albedo and such
\item 5 Hz update rate
\item 0.5 U size, 7-24 arc-second accuracy
\item Can also be used to measure angular rates, by using star smeared in the image and calculating it's radius of curvature, and thus removing need of gyro
\end{itemize}
\item Disadvantages
\begin{itemize}
\item Gets disturbed by stray light. More than 1 might be needed in this case
\item Problematic during detumbling 
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

%\item Sun sensor 
%\begin{itemize}
%\item More than 1 needed
%\item Accuracy less than star-tracker
%\end{itemize}

\item Active control dataset packages 
\begin{itemize}
\item 0.003$^o$ pointing accuracy, 0.5W power consumption, 0.5U size 
\item Sensors and actuators included
\begin{itemize}
\item Magnetometer
\item IMU
\item Sun sensor
\item 3 reaction wheels 
\item 3 torque rods
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item Other instruments that might be needed
\begin{itemize}
\item Normal Cameras
\item Infrared Cameras
\item Lights/Bulbs - In case we are going to do advertisements, or vision based inter-satellite distance measurement. 
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
